# FEAPB 1.0

**FEAPB** (**F**inite **E**lement **A**nalysis of **P**iezoelectric **B**eams) is a software for solving linear static, modal and dynamic three-dimensional piezoelectric beam problems. FEAPB is the outcome of an Erasmus Mundus project on "Higher Order Finite Elements for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Beams" (find the theory in the directory "Theory_Behind_FEAPB"), carried out at the Civil & Computational Engineering Centre, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.

## Disclaimer
**FEAPB** has been specifically designed to be used as a GUI-based application and not as a front-end API. Although, pull requests, patches and bug reports are always welcome, the source code is distributed just for convenience as part of the open-source lincense.

**FEAPB** has been developed in full compliance with ISO C++11 and the use of following open-source graphical/numerical linear algebra libraries is highly appreciated:

	Eigen 3.2.0		http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/	MPL2
	Qt 5.1.0		http://qt-project.org/		LGPL
	Boost 1.5.4		http://www.boost.org/		Boost (BSL)          
	QCustomPlot 1.0.1	http://www.qcustomplot.com/	GPL
	
The user-interface (FEAPB.exe) has been successfully tested on Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. The run-time libraries provided are for MS Windows.
